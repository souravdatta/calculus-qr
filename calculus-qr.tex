\section{Ratios}
\textbf{Definition}: Ratio is the relation between two quantities of \textit{same} kind which describes what part or multiple is one of the another and it is usually written as,
\[ \  A : B \]
$A$ and $B$ are called the \textit{terms} of the ratio. 
A ratio has the following properties,
\[ a:b=ma:mb \]
\[ {a \over b}:{c \over d} = {ad:bc} \]
